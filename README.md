# Blackjack

* The user starts with 500 dollars and then they are prompted to wager an amount on the game. After they choose how much money, the game of blackjack begins with them getting dealt a hand and asking whether they would like to hit or stay.
* After the user is done, the dealer checks if the user went over 21. If the user went over 21, the dealer (computer) automatically wins.
* If the user didn't go over 21, the dealer will play their hand and then compares scores. Program then updates the user's bank accordingly (dealer wins ties).
* If the user doesn't have any money left the game is over, but if they do have money left they get the option to play again
